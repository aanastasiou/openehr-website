			<h1>About this Website</h1>
			<p>This new website aims to be more representative of the openEHR community aims and activities and particularly what people are working on out there. Don't consider it as fixed, but rather as a living thing. We are interested in feedback on any aspect of the website. In the initial development phase, visual elements and style are 'draft', and we welcome ideas for improvement.</p>
			<p>Note that the technical approach we have taken with this site is a totally manual one - that is, it is constructed from hand-built HTML, PHP, and Java-script. This gives more freedom than the controlled environment of a CMS. Moving to a CMS is not out of the question in the future, but for now, the current approach seems more maintainable. The website code is maintained on Github, and contributors can participate by providing material via that route.</p>

			<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
			<p>Please provide website design ideas/feedback <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/oecom/2012+Website+-+feedback+page">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Routine webmaster requests <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a>.
			
			<h2>Logo</h2>
			<p>As openEHR is moving forward we think it is time to refresh the Foundation image. Besides the new website, there is also a possibility for openEHR community to create a new openEHR logo. A few proposals have been made already.</p>		
			<p>The table below shows candidates so far, and until end Dec 2012, we will accept new candidates. You can send your own creation <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a> which will appear here.&#42; Following this, a community vote on the logo will be arranged. </p>

				<td class="TableMainC"><p><img width="200px" alt="current logo" title="current logo" src="files/basic/openEHRlogo.png"></p></td>
				<td class="TableMainC">This is the current openEHR logo - the simple graphic, with the distinctive orange and blue colours. The new website follows this colour scheme.</td>
				<td class="TableMainC">The fonts in logo are standard fonts with shadow effect.</td>

				<td class="TableMainC"><p><img width="200px" alt="board logo" title="board logo" src="files/basic/candidate1.png"></p></td>
				<td class="TableMainC">This logo candidate is from the interim openEHR board.</td>
				<td class="TableMainC"> Change in colours and fonts of openEHR and new globe graphic added.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="TableMainC"><p><img width="200px" alt="test logo 1" title="test logo 1" src="files/basic/openEHR_test_logo_1.png"></p></td>
				<td class="TableMainC">This is a test logo intended to show a possible basic structure of a new logo.</td>
				<td class="TableMainC">The idea would be to keep the existing 'openEHR' word in the current colours (since this is very recognisable), and to add something graphical on the right side. This demonstration logo is just a quick one showing the sun and birds.</td>
			</tr>

			</table>
			<br/>
			
			<p>&#42; For new proposals, we suggest retaining the distinctive blue and orange colours. It seems reasonable to also retain the basic form of the 'openEHR' word and potentially add something to the right of it or on / around it. This would ensure a visual connection with the existing openEHR brand, which will help people in the community.</p>
			
			<h2>Home page banner image</h2>
			<p>You can also propose home page banner graphics. The table below shows some candidates. You can also send your own picture/graphic design (size: 200x75px in transparent PNG format) <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a>. The deadline for banner candidates is 31 December 2012. A vote will be arranged following this date.</p>

				<td class="TableMainC">Clear graphic: this contains only openEHR logo, motto, search and links. Right now it is set as default.</td>

				<p>Click to enlarge</p></td>
				<td class="TableMainC">The 'doctors' graphic: this is just an idea at this stage: an image that tells the outside world that openEHR is something to do with healthcare and computing. Doctors in white coats are not particularly representative of all healthcare workers, but we have found no obvious alternative so far, since in reality most healthcare workers look like normal people. The doctors graphic may also seem more in the style of commercial e-health vendor advertising rather than a .org. Alternatives: any visual content that gives the idea of computing in healthcare, or perhaps something more abstract.</td>

			<h2>The motto</h2>
			<p>This is meant to be a short sharp expression of what the openEHR Foundation and its community are about. Key ideas to include seems to be: archetypes/content models; flexibility/future-proofing/adaptibility of systems. Clearly no slogan can capture everything about a large effort like openEHR, so there will never be a perfect one. On the other hand being memorable is useful. Suggestions are welcome <a href="mailto:webmaster@openehr.org">here</a>.</p>
