			<h2>Individual membership</h2>
			<p>Individual Membership in openEHR is free. There are various categories of membership, based on experience and responsibility. Transitioning from one level of involvement to the next is done on the basis of merit, in a similar fashion to the Apache Software Foundation 'meritocracy' concept.</p>
