Firstly, not only does the data representation			have to be standardised so as to be shared, its semantics - i.e. clinical structure and meaning - have to be standardised. A standard approach to querying is also needed.</p>									<h2>What can openEHR do for you</h2>			<p>openEHR supports such an information infrastructure, because it is designed to represent semantic models of content, from the GUI through to the database.			It is an integrated framework rather than a set of disparate official standards which themselves need to be integrated.			It supports the definition of clinical content via archetypes - in fact, the archetype formalism is now a CEN standard (EN13606-2),			and will be an ISO standard by end 2008. Via the use of openEHR Templates, shareable data sets can be defined across any jurisdiction.			These features provide a basis for defining the shared clinical, demographic and administrative semantics across jurisdictions			up to and including the national level.</p>			<p>Strategically, openEHR offers 3 key features for national e-health programmes:</p>			<ul>				<li>a health computing platform approach, which opens up health data for use by multiple applications; this leads to a <em>platform-based health ICT economy</em>,				in which various suppliers can produce back- or front-end systems that integrate across a defined interface, rather than the current situation of numerous silos;</li>				<li><em>clinical content and process modelling is managed by clinicians</em>, separately from the software, using the powerful openEHR archetype and template formalisms;</li>				<li><em>integration of existing standards and systems</em> currently supporting existing standards is managed semantically, using the openEHR template data schema approach.</li>			</ul>						<h2>How you can get involved</h2>			<p>You can become openEHR Partner through the Organisational membership, or members of your team can become part of openEHR as the Individual members.

In 2008, the Danish and Swedish governments decided to use openEHR for clinical modelling.</p>			<p>For list of countries which are using openEHR technology see <a href="../../who_is_using_openehr#governments">who is using openEHR</a>.</p>					</div>				</div>	<div id="BottomMenu">	<?php include '../../menu/bottommenu.php' ?>	</div>	<div id="BottomPanel">	<?php include '../../panel/bottompanel.php' ?>	</div></div>	<script type="text/javascript">var dropdown=new MENU.dropdown.init("dropdown", {id:'menu', active:'menuhover'});</script></body></html>
