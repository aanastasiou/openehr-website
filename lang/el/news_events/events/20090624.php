			<h2>openEHR at International Free Software Forum</h2>
			<h6>24. - 27. June 2009 | Porto Alegre</h6>
			<br/>
			
			<p>Tim Cook has been selected as an invited lecturer at the 10th Edition of International Free Software Forum or fisl10 [1], to be held at the Pontif&iacute;cia Universidade Cat&oacute;lica (PUC-RS), from June 24th to 27th, 2009, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil.</p>
			<p>This event attracts more than 7,000 free and open source software developers and other participants each year.</p>
			<p>fisl10 is promoted by Projeto Software Livre Brasil (Brazilian Fre Software Project), a networked organization of individuals who promote and develop Free Software. It's organized by Projeto Software Livre Rio Grande do Sul - regional branch of Projeto Software Livre Brasil[2] - and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o SoftwareLivre.Org[3], a non-profit organization comprising several of Projeto Software Livre Rio Grande do Sul activists, located at Porto Alegre/RS/Brazil.</p>
			<p>Past speakers include Novell's Miguel de Icaza, HP's Bdale Garbee, OLPC's Jim Gettys, OSI's Eric Raymond, LI's John "Maddog" Hall, and OpenBSD's Theo De Raadt. We have simultaneous translation into English, and Portuguese as a lot of our attendees are non-brazilians.</p>
			<p>Tim will be speaking on the fundamentals of openEHR, how and why it is a different approach to semantic interoperability in healthcare application development and the importances of this approach.  He will also be demonstrating the Open Source Healthcare Platform (OSHIP) which is based on the openEHR Python reference implementation.</p>
