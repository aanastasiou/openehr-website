			<h1>Announcements</h1>
			<h2>Announcement concerning progress with IHTSDO and future directions</h2>
			<h6>21. December 2010 | from: David Ingram, Sam Heard and Dipak Kalra</h6>
			<br/>
			<p>At its October meeting in Toronto, the General Assembly of the IHTSDO
			received and discussed a proposal, submitted by its Management Board, to
			support, develop and maintain the IP in openEHR, within a broader
			framework of IHTSDO governance for clinical content of the electronic health
			record.</p>
			<h3>IHTSDO Decision</h3>
			<p>The openEHR Foundation Board has now heard from the IHTSDO
			Management Board, saying that, whilst the objective of the proposal was
			considered by the GA to be within the scope of the organisation and that it
			represented a pressing issue for their governments, it was unable to reach
			consensus that going forward with openEHR in this way is the right
			choice, at this time.</p>
			<p>It confirmed its wish to continue a pathway of harmonisation with
			openEHR and expressed considerable appreciation for the work done in
			setting out the proposal, by the working group of Foundation and IHTSDO members.
			The pathway forward that they have chosen is the creation of an IHTSDO Task
			Force, to review the requirements for clinical content standardisation, afresh,
			and then proceed towards an open process for meeting those requirements, in
			which openEHR would be invited to participate.</p>
			<p>This is disappointing from our perspective as we believed that the IHTSDO was
			a good organisation with which to partner, to provide the broader governance for
			developing and maintaining the openEHR specifications and related
			tooling that we have been seeking. We have been encouraged, in successive stages
			over two years, to actively engage in this dialogue to seek greater
			harmonisation between eHealth standards bodies. It is a time of financial
			hardship and the openEHR Foundation did seek a significant injection of
			funds into the specifications and tooling: this may have been a contributing
			factor in the decision. It was critical to the Board that this move did involve
			an injection of capital.</p>
			<p>We much appreciate our close working links with many staff and members of
			IHTSDO, formed in the process of working with them to generate the proposal that
			has not, sadly, found favour at this time. A number have been long-standing and
			loyal advocates for what we are trying to achieve. These will, we hope, be
			maintained in the future, despite our pressing need to move forward
			independently. Despite the apparently negative outcome at this stage, we are
			minded to now look at the opportunities that are on offer to take the
			specifications forward.</p>
			
			<h3>Future</h3>
			<p>The Foundation now needs to find a smarter way forward which continues to
			build the momentum behind openEHR and develops opportunities for
			members individually and collectively. We believe there is no doubt that the
			momentum for enabling eHealth platforms such as</p>
			
			<h3>Announcement concerning progress with IHTSDO and future directions</h3>
			<p>More people are realising the importance of a standard,
			tool-based approach to content definition and the distributed electronic health
			record. The health record is becoming an important asset for each citizen, for
			every provider and for the good of society.</p>
			<p>The Foundation&rsquo;s view is that standardisation of a knowledge-enabled EHR
			computing platform is a critically important step to support international
			efforts of healthcare reform; a step that will lead to genuine diversity of
			applications, empowerment of individuals and beneficial health outcomes. Health
			systems are under pressure, and a properly engineered, cost-effective and
			flexible platform is necessary.</p>
			<p>The Foundation wishes to acknowledge that the future success of
			openEHR now clearly lies in the hands on the openEHR community
			itself. The Foundation is therefore seeking support for an international meeting
			to define and establish a new way of working. The meeting will discuss ideas
			about how to progress the work of openEHR and ensure that more people
			benefit from it. We would like to invite initial discussions on organising this
			meeting on the openEHR lists, which Sam Heard will moderate.</p>
			<p class="par">We sense there are a number of central requirements for moving forward and
			wish to seek the community&rsquo;s opinion on next steps. These include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The potential for a new Consortium that owns and provides suitable
			governance for the oversight, IP and other assets of the Foundation &ndash; this might
			comprise professional organisations, universities and industry;</li>
			<li>Resources to ensure that information about openEHR continues to
			grow, specifications are maintained and the business of creating a standard
			health record platform that works continues;</li>
			<li>A collaborative &lsquo;refresh&rsquo; and focussing of the aims and ambitions of the
			openEHR community;</li>
			<li>Practical engagement with clinical groups, through the Foundation and all
			its participants to ensure that the improvements sought by health services are
			supported by openEHR efforts;</li>
			<li>Maintenance of a lean and agile engineering approach that avoids expending
			time and effort without practical and incremental gain for the community;</li>
			<li>Alignment of the efforts of academia and industry around production of open
			source software tooling to support greater international collaboration and
			increased uptake of openEHR;</li>
			<li>A roadmap to ensure that openEHR becomes a universal EHR &ndash; the
			record that can accept information from all current systems and can be
			implemented using the latest technological approaches.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>Thank you for your patience during this extended period of uncertainty. We
			apologise for any difficulties and tensions this has created. We all have
			choices and we appreciate you may choose you to invest your energy and effort
			elsewhere. Rather, we hope that the aspirations and energy this community shares
			will drive us all forward to support and deliver the paradigm shift that is
			required in eHealth. We appreciate your support at this time.</p>
